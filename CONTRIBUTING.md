# Contributing to exactextract

This project welcomes external contributions via pull requests. Before opening
a pull request and/or spending significant development time, please open an
issue to discuss your proposed changes and ensure sure the maintainers will be
available to review your contribution.

Automated checks are applied to pull requests to ensure that code changes
adhere to the style used in this repository. The easiest way to do this
is to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and enable it for your
cloned repository. This will install pre-commit hooks to automatically
reformat and check code before committing.
