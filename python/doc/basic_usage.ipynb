    "Most tasks can be completed using the `exact_extract` function.\n",

    "The following examples demonstrate the use of `exact_extract` to summarize population and elevation data from the\n",
    "[Gridded Population of the World](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4)\n",
    "and [EU-DEM](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-eu-dem)\n",
    "datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `exactextractr` R package package includes samples of both of these datasets,\n",
    "cropped to the extent of São Miguel, the largest and most populous island of the Azores archipelago.\n",
    "The package also provides boundaries for the six municipalities, or _concelhos_, that cover the island.\n",
    "These files can be accessed from [GitHub](https://github.com/isciences/exactextractr/tree/master/inst/sao_miguel).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the sample data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `exact_extract` function can accept inputs from several popular libraries such as GDAL, rasterio, fiona, and GeoPandas.\n",
    "A filename can also be provided, in which case `exact_extract` will load the data using whichever of these libraries is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is not needed to complete the analysis, the following code can be used to plot the sample datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot below shows the population count file from GPW. This raster provides the total population in each pixel for the calendar year 2020. On top of the population grid, we plot boundaries for the six municipalities, or concelhos, into which the island is divided. We can see that the population is concentrated along the coastlines, with smaller communities located in volcanic calderas inland."
