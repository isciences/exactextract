Available Operations
====================

``exactextract`` provides numerous built-in operations for summarizing gridded data.
This page provides a list of the :ref:`operations` and :ref:`arguments tuning their behavior <operation_arguments>`.
If a built-in operation is not suitable, custom operations can be defined when using eithe the Python or R bindings.

.. note::

   All of the operations listed in this page are supported in the command-line interface and Python bindings.
   Some operations are not currently available in R.

.. _operations:

Built-in operations
-------------------

  * :math:`x_i` represents the value of the *ith* raster cell,
  * :math:`c_i` represents the fraction of the *ith* raster cell that is covered by the polygon (unless directed otherwise by the ``coverage_weight`` argument), and
  * :math:`w_i` represents the weight of the *ith* raster cell.

Values in the "example result" column refer to the value and weighting rasters shown below.
In these images, values of the "value raster" range from 1 to 4, and values of the "weighting raster" range from 5 to 8.
The area covered by the polygon is shaded purple.

.. _operation_arguments:

Operation arguments
-------------------

The behavior of these statistics may be modified by the following arguments:

  * ``coverage_weight`` - specifies the value to use for :math:`c_i` in the above formulas. The following methods are available:
     - `fraction` - the default method, with :math:`c_i` ranging from 0 to 1
     - `none` - :math:`c_i` is always equal to 1; all pixels are given the same weight in the above calculations regardless of their coverage fraction
     - `area_cartesian` - :math:`c_i` is the fraction of the pixel multiplied by it x and y resolutions
     - `area_spherical_m2` - :math:`c_i` is the fraction of the pixel that is covered multiplied by a spherical approximation of the cell's area in square meters
     - `area_spherical_km2` - :math:`c_i` is the fraction of the pixel that is covered multiplied by a spherical approximation of the cell's area in square kilometers
  * ``default_value`` - specifies a value to be used for NODATA pixels instead of ignoring them
  * ``default_weight`` - specifies a weighing value to be used for NODATA pixels instead of ignoring them
  * ``min_coverage_frac`` - specifies the minimum fraction of the pixel (0 to 1) that must be covered in order for a pixel to be considered in calculations. Defaults to 0.
